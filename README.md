During my spare moments, I've been diligently crafting a game that's still a work in progress. My vision includes adding levels and introducing the concept of purchasing fluids with in-game coins, features yet to be realized. The game boasts a plethora of mechanics, including a seed growth cycle triggered by watering, particle effects with collision detection, sophisticated save system utilizing JSON utility,vertex displacement shader to make moving crops effect and water shader. Additionally, I've incorporated an inventory system for collecting fruits and a shop interface for procuring seeds, with more enhancements planned for the future.

In the video i have disable all the crops because of some bug in shop system only corn is available thats why you are seeing only corn count. If the player gets any other crops it will be added to inventory.
