During my spare moments, I've been diligently crafting a game that's still a work in progress. My vision includes adding levels and introducing the concept of purchasing fluids with in-game coins, features yet to be realized. The game boasts a plethora of mechanics, including a seed growth cycle triggered by watering, particle effects with collision detection, sophisticated save system utilizing JSON utility,vertex displacement shader to make moving crops effect and water shader. Additionally, I've incorporated an inventory system for collecting fruits and a shop interface for procuring seeds, with more enhancements planned for the future.
