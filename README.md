During my spare moments, I've been diligently crafting a game that's still a work in progress. My vision includes adding levels and introducing the concept of purchasing fluids with in-game coins, features yet to be realized. The game boasts a plethora of mechanics, including a seed growth cycle triggered by watering, particle effects with collision detection, and a sophisticated save system utilizing JSON utility. Additionally, I've incorporated an inventory system for collecting fruits and a shop interface for procuring seeds, with more enhancements planned for the future.
